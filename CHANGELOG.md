### Added
- DateFieldPlus now also supports multiselection
- extended xdatefield to support multiselection
- "value" config for datefieldplus now also supports arrays in multiselection mode instead of just one date
- range selection is now also possible for a wider period than only the visible months
- updated xdatefield code integration to disable/enable the hidden submitfield from datefieldplus also, if the mainformfield gets disabled/enabled
- improved xdatefield code to fill the hiddenField with a given value at config time
- Improved some code-sections (mainly for respecting summertime changings when handling with Date.gettime())
- Corrected eventhandling on Datemenu and DateFieldPlus
- support for minDate and maxDate for Datefieldplus (as an alias for datepickers minValue and maxValue) to be more compatible to usual datepicker/datemenu config options
- "multiSelectionDelimiter" config (datefieldplus and multiselection only)
- "renderPrevNextButtons" config (if you want the user not to be able to change the month or force him to use the monthpicker)

- "showActiveDate" will display the active Date to use keynavigation
- "shiftSpaceSelect" if set to true (default) and showactivedate is set to true you can select dates on keynavigation by using shift+Space (because the space-key alone will select the today-date)
	if this is set to false , this behaviour reverses (shift+space selects today, space alone select the date under the shown activedate from keynavigation)
- "disableMonthPicker" config
- "disabledLetter" config to display e.g. a "X" instead of the daynumber if a date is disabled. (default false)

### Added
- the state of the afterdateclick to examine, if the date was selected or unselected, same with week/month
- option to cleanSelectedDates to not update the picker (e.g. to immediatly add dates manually by setSelectedDates(that would call update twice)

### Added
- method setMinDate() to change the minDate at runtime and immediatly update the datepicker
- method setMaxDate() to change the maxDate at runtime and immediatly update the datepicker

### Fixed
- hidden submitformat Field had same name as original field, thus confuses IE with duplicate id/name. if name has not been specified in the config or is same as id datefieldplus will add a suffix to the hiddenfield (default "-format"). this field holds the custom submitFormat value

## 0.9 Beta 3 - 2008-04-06
### Added

## 0.9 Beta - 2008-04-05
### Added
Joined the extensions together nicely and added even more features:
- fixed some bugs/improved the original extensions a bit
- works on Original DateMenu and DateField (Ext.ux.DateFieldPlus) also
- Definable Multimonths (rows,amount,fill..)
- Custom CSS for definable days
- Weeknumber Display
- Weekend CSS Styling
- National Holidays CSS Styling
- Quicktip support
- Function based custom displayed days
- Multiselection support by CTRL-Key to add single days (when clicked on a date)
- Multiselection support by CTRL-Key to add single weeks (when clicked on a weeknumber)
- Multiselection support by CTRL-Key to add single months (when clicked on the weeknumber header)
- Multiselection support by SHIFT-Key to add a range of days depending on the lastclicked day (when clicked on a single date)
- returned the prev/next monthbuttons to the monthlabelrow
- implemented mousewheel-event again for comfortable increasing/decreasing months
- implemented monthpicker again to comfortably select the starting month. the monthpicker is rendered on the very first monthname so with only 1 month given, it acts just like the original datepicker
- added quick dayselection routine without calling update() every time. MUCH faster selection, especially when using huge multimonth calendars!
- added "OK"- and "Undo"-Buttons when multiSelection is set to true
- unneccessary renderupdate trigger eliminated (performance-leak on huge multimonthcalendars!) (setvalue-function changed, much more faster now)
- prevented opening a new browsertab in IE7/IE8 when CTRL multiselecting (occured in original multimonth calendar extension and datepicker also if clicked on an empty area within the cell) (default behaviour for a-tags, prevented this by CSS)
- extend keynavigation (RETURN=ok-Button, CTRL as usual)
- added Tooltip functionality to DateFieldPlus just like Buttons (tooltip show on triggerbutton only, this way invalidtext tooltips stay intact)
